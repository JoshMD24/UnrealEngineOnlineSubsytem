# UnrealEngineOnlineSubsytem
This is a basic NULL OSS I created inside of Unreal Engine 4.26
This OSS will allow you to create, find, and join sessions.
This OSS is using NULL at the moment and is only searching for LAN matches however if you want to make this work with steam servers it will only take a few small changes.
This is fully functioning and players on different computers can connect to each other and play.
This is currently using a listen server not a dedicated server.
